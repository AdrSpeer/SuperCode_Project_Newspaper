              <p>
                More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot
                handles can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.

                More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were
                most common.

              <h3>Knife cuts</h3>
              <p>
                Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen
                type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to
                the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually
                more dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more
                pressure to use and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip
                off food and into your fingers.

              <h3>Cooking fires</h3>
              <p>
                Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five
                reported home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for
                one in three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or
                related substances, according to the National Fire Protection
                Association.

              <h3>Contact Burns From Equipment</h3>
              <p>
                The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an
                open fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps
                the heat contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all
                that heat combined with metal components and cookware leads to
                loads of burns. Quick tips (which are obvious, but good to keep
                in mind): Always use oven mitts, replace them when they’re old;
                don’t use a wet towel as an oven mitt; don’t reach your arm in
                to check baked goods, pull out the rack to test;

              <h3>Death to the Pathogens</h3>
              <p>
                The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs
                lurking in your food. The Centers for Disease Control and
                Prevention (CDC) estimates that each year roughly one in six
                Americans (or 48 million people) gets sick, 128,000 are
                hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases. The top five
                culprits sending Americans to the hospital are salmonella,
                norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma gondii and E.coli –
                but much can be done in terms of proper food handling, cooking
                and storage to help prevent these pathogens from causing
                illness.
